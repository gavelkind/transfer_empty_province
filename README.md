This mod for Crusader Kings II allows non-nomadic rulers to transfer empty provinces to the de jure duke. This removes the duke's "desires county" opinion penalty, and allows the duke to build settlements in the province with his own money.

Players can use the decision by right-clicking a county title. AI rulers will use the decision if they have no immediate use for the province (such as enough money to build a settlement) and are not greedy or ambitious.
